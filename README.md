# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This project performs Twitter sentiment analysis using a Logistic Regression model. It preprocesses tweets with **NLTK** and converts them to numerical data with **Scikit-learn's** TF-IDF. The final trained model is saved via pickle, allowing a separate script to load it and predict the sentiment of new tweets.
